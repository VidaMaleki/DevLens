**DevLens** is an AI-powered assistant for developers working in VS Code.  
It helps you understand unfamiliar codebases faster by summarizing files directly in your editor — powered by OpenAI's GPT-4o.

🧠 Whether you're onboarding to a new repo or reviewing old code, DevLens gives you a head start.
